# Product Guidelines - Argentum Online Godot

## Visual Identity
- **Preserve the Classic:** Maintain the original pixel art and UI layout of the 0.13.3 client to ensure a faithful experience.
- **Subtle Enhancements:** While preserving the core look, utilize Godot's modern rendering capabilities for improved lighting and atmospheric effects without deviating from the original aesthetic.

## Gameplay & Quality Standards
- **Authenticity First:** Prioritize "Bug-for-Bug Compatibility" where necessary to preserve the unique gameplay balance and "feel" that defines Argentum Online.
- **Fidelity to Original Mechanics:** Every movement, combat interaction, and system should mirror the original client's behavior as closely as possible.

## Asset & Resource Management
- **Direct Porting Strategy:** Focus on utilizing or directly converting original Argentum Online asset formats (like `.ind`, `.dat`, and `.idx`) to Godot-native structures.
- **Format Integrity:** Ensure that the conversion process maintains the visual and data integrity of the original resources.
